This repository contains a Python script (Automated Shape Recognition with OpenCV.py) that performs automated shape recognition on an image using OpenCV.

Features
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Image Loading and Preprocessing: Reads an input image and converts it to grayscale for processing.

Contour Detection: Identifies contours within the image to outline different shapes.

Shape Recognition: Recognizes common geometric shapes such as triangles, squares, rectangles, pentagons, and stars based on their number of vertices.

Visual Output: Draws and labels the identified shapes directly on the original image.

Getting Started
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed, along with the OpenCV library:

  Bash

  pip install opencv-python numpy

How to Run
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Place an image named shapes.jpg in the same directory as the script. This image should contain the shapes you wish to recognize.

2.Save the code as Automated Shape Recognition with OpenCV.py.

3.Run the script from your terminal:

  Bash

  python "Automated Shape Recognition with OpenCV.py"
  
The script will process the shapes.jpg image, identify the shapes, and display the result. Press any key to close the displayed image.
